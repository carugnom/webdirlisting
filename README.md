# WebDirListing

Minimal HTTP server excercise.  
It serves filesystem contents from server's root directory, allowing navigation between subdirectories.  
Some subdirectories and files are included to test navigation, feel free to create more.  

## Running the server

Execute the `main.py` file.  

```sh
$ python main.py
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8888` from your browser and start using it.
